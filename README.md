# Blackhole-Demo-UE4

- Built a physics-based blackhole using Blueprints that utilizes vector maths at its core to attract
objects. There can be multiple Blackhole blueprints in the scene as well, interacting with the
objects simultaneously.

- Also made a specific material for the light bending effect around the blackhole.
